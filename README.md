# The Kilobyte Cat Rescue
Welcome to the Kilobyte Cat Rescue! This is a unique shelter â€” all of the cats are randomly generated! Despite their digital existence, these cats are still adorable and looking for new homes... perhaps you might have a place for one in your code? Take a look, you might just meet a new fictional friend!

## Goals
